# Mancala Game GUI
An expansion of my text-based Mancala game that was made for an academic project.

## Features
- Interactive GUI
- 2 different rulesets for gameplay
- Saving/loading game and player states

## Usage
A .jar file is included in the repository with the latest build. Requires Java 17 to run properly as other versions have not been tested yet. 
When running the .jar file, it will create an "assets" folder in the same directory as the .jar file if it is not already present. The "assets" folder stores the game and player saves.

## Roadmap
Potential features that are being looked into and may be included in the future.
- Various bug fixes
- Compatibility with other versions
- Custom file names for saving
- Playing against a computer (single-player)

## Acknowledgements
- CIS2430 (Object-Oriented Programming) from the University of Guelph
